# NOTES
Apologies in advance for bad pixel art, and incorrect coloring, I am new to pixel art.

## It's All In The Details
One thing I found out is you can do a ton in a small amount of space. Compare these two:

![rock](/rock.png?raw=true "Rock")
![mario](/mario.png?raw=true "Mario")

On the left: we have a 32x17 rock.

On the right: we have a 14x20 man with eyes, a nose, ears, side-burns, a mustache, a hat, gloves, overals with two buttons, and shoes.

## Shading Makes A Difference
![mario](/mario.png?raw=true "Mario")
![mario without shading](/mario-no-shade.png?raw=true "Mario Without Shading")

On the right, I have removed the shading. Without shading, he looks flatter and more pixely.

## Leave It To The Imagination
![mario](/mario.png?raw=true "Mario")
![mario without details](/mario-no-flavor.png?raw=true "Mario Without Details")

On the right, I have removed the hat, extra outlining, gloves, buttons, and sideburns. We have seriously degredaded Mario to a blob of pixels.

I believe the more that is left to the imagination the better. Using a hat to cover the head, allows the viewer to imagine the head as round. Covering the hands with gloves means we don't need to add in details for the individual fingers. Adding a few border pixels around Mario's nose and neck make the pieces look less abrupt.
